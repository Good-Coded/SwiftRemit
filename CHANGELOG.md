# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **#925** Automated mainnet deployment checklist CI (`mainnet-checklist.yml`) enforcing WASM build, full test suite, no TODO/FIXME in security-critical files, CHANGELOG update, and Clippy strict; `deploy-mainnet.yml` workflow blocks on checklist passing. Manual checklist items documented in `PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md`.
- **#933** Cargo-fuzz targets for `validate_amount`, corridor validation, and `validate_evidence_hash` (recipient hash), with seed corpus and a 30-second CI job (`fuzz-ci.yml`).
- **#938** Content Security Policy enforced on the frontend: strict CSP in Vite dev server, `<meta>` tag injection for production builds, HTTP response headers in `vercel.json` and `_headers`. Staging uses `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` first before production enforcement.
- **#940** Input sanitization applied to all user-supplied string fields across backend API endpoints (`api.ts`, `routes/compliance.ts`) and API service routes (`agents`, `auth`, `anchors`). Parameterized query audit confirmed across all DB-touching code paths.

### Deprecated
- **#1680** `blacklist_user`, `remove_from_blacklist`, and `set_user_blacklisted` are deprecated in favor of `set_blacklist_status`; the thin wrappers will be removed in the next ABI version.

### Changed
- **#1679** `get_daily_limit_status` now returns `resets_at = 0` when `used == 0` (no in-window transfers), instead of `now + 24h`. A non-zero `resets_at` is only reported once the rolling window has activity.

### Fixed
- Dark mode support with CSS custom properties and theme toggle component
- Correlation ID propagation from API through to webhook delivery
- CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- Automated release workflow with GitHub Actions

### Security
- All free-form string fields in `backend/src/api.ts` and `backend/src/routes/compliance.ts` now pass through `sanitizeInput` (XSS library) before storage.
- API service (`api/src/routes/`) sanitizes `name`, `payout_address`, `userId`, and anchor provider string fields via a new `sanitizeInput`/`sanitizeObject` utility.
- `validateAssetParams` middleware now mutates `req.body` with sanitized `assetCode` and `issuer` before passing to route handlers.

### Fixed (previous)
- `withdraw_integrator_fees` correctly returns `NoFeesToWithdraw` when balance is zero
